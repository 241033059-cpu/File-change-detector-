# duplicate-file-finder-
This project is a Menu-Driven Duplicate File Finder written in Bash (Linux Shell Scripting).
The objective of the script is to identify duplicate files in a directory by using their MD5 checksum values.
Files that have the same content will always generate the same MD5 hash, even if their names are different.
This makes it possible to accurately detect duplicate files.
